A key part of operating resilient cloud applications is monitoring them.  But it can be challenging to ensure that all aspects of your applications and infrastructure are captured.  Monitoring point solutions can create silos of data, and can require a lot of infrastructure to store all the data points that might be signficant in root cause analysis. 

Tanzu enables you to offer observability capabilities as a service to your developers and operators.  And Tanzu accelerates your teams by providing out of the box views of application and infrastructure KPIs that are fully customizable.
