So now we have our application, and our database service deployed to one cluster.  But the landing zone for your applications isn't likely to just be one cluster.  You have multiple datacenters, and increasingly one more of those datacenters is in the public cloud.  Your applications are going to land on clusters that are provided for you by another provider, or are managed for you as a service in the public cloud.  Are all those clusters set up and secured according to best practices and meeting your standards?

Tanzu includes a supported, standards compliant Kubernetes distribution that can run across both public and private clouds and is closely aligned with the open source, upstream Kubernetes.  Tanzu makes it simple for your administrators to deploy and manage Kubernetes everywhere.  And we even offer an integrated Tanzu Kubernetes distribution into the core of vSphere, so that your administrators have the aboslute best Kubernetes experience possible on your VMware infrastructure.

But the value of Tanzu isn't linked strictly to our own Kubernetes distribution.  Tanzu gives you the tools ensure that all of your clusters, VMware provided or not, have the stricted security and compliance policies defined, are protected from catastrophes, and are standards compliant.

* Go to TMC tab.  Show the cluster group and how it contains clusters from all over.
* Click on the Policies section and hit a few of the tabs under the "Assignments" section.  Call out central access control and rights management.  Call out how you can ensure that clusters only pull containers from your trusted registries.  Mention network policies, and then click on "Security".  Click "Create a security policy" and note that we provide templates that already contain best practices out of the box.  Mention quota controls to prevent someone from hogging the cluster.  
* Then if that isn't enough, we provide a completely customizable way to write compliance rules that helps you do things like promote best practices for your applications.  Click on the "Templates" section, and show the "deploymentreplicaminimum".  Explain how this rule ensures that developers are only allowed to deploy applications that run multiple instances so that you can promote resiliency standards for your production applications.
* Click on "Inspections" and show how you can run compliance scans against your clusters to make sure they meet standards like Kubernetes API standards and CIS Benchmark standards.  Click into failure for CIS benchmarks.
* Finally, go back to cluster groups and navigate to the "pez-tools-vpshere" cluster.  Highlight the data protection capability to backup your application manifests and persistent data to secured cloud storage that only you have access to.
