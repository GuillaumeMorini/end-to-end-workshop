Within Tanzu Observability, access the Dynamically Generated Application Dashboard for Spring Pet Clinic. Application -> Application Status

Click on your Application, click on the petclinic service. You now see the dynamically generated dashboard.

Clone the dashboard

Click "Settings" followed by "Advanced"

Add the following events query events(name="petclinic-deploy")

Save the dashboard and name it something specific to your user name. I chose dpfeffer-petclinic-dashboard.

In your dashboard at the top right where it says "Show Events" change it to "From Dashboard Settings". This will cause your events query to be the source of events for all charts in your dashboard.
